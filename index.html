                    <h2>Christianity</h2>
                    <p>Favorite quote, "What we do in life, echoes in eternity."</p>
                    <p>Make sure you know what you believe and why. </p>
					<p>As C.S. Lewis said in The Weight of Glory, “It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which,if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.” </p>
					<p> We are all eternal beings ...  it is just a matter of where we spend that eternity.</p>

                    <h2>Boardgames</h2>
                    <p>I just recently got back into boardgames.  There are so many! and all better than the Monopoly or RISK I grew up with.</p>

                    <h2>Woodworking</h2>
                    <p>Shaping wood and building something useful always brings me peace. (Until I mess it up.  :-P )</p>
